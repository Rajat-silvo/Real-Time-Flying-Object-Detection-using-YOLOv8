# Real-Time-Flying-Object-Detection-using-YOLOv8

● Designed an object detection model with YOLOv8, achieving improved accuracy in identifying and localizing objects
across multiple categories.

● Monitored and optimized model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, map, and loss functions to
ensure balanced accuracy and generalization.

● Utilized Python, PyTorch, Google Colab for model training and evaluation, leveraging data augmentation and
regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting.
